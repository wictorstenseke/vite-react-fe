### Cursor Rules – Authority & Discovery (Modular Rules)

You must always:

1. Discover rules first
   - Read `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files before doing anything else
   - Rule files in this project:
     - `.cursor/rules/global.mdc` (always applied)
     - `.cursor/rules/react-components.mdc`
     - `.cursor/rules/tanstack-query.mdc`
     - `.cursor/rules/tanstack-router.mdc`
     - `.cursor/rules/testing.mdc`
     - `.cursor/rules/ui-components.mdc`

2. Treat rules as authoritative
   - These rules override your default behavior and any generic best practices

3. Never bypass rules
   - Do not proceed with edits, refactors, dependency choices, or scaffolding if rules exist but haven't been read
   - If instructions conflict, stop and ask for clarification (do not "choose one")

4. Keep rules in sync
   - If you add new tooling or conventions, propose an update to the relevant rules file

Output requirement:

- At the top of your first response, briefly list which rule files you read (file paths only)
