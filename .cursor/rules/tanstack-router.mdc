# TanStack Router Conventions

## File Structure

- Route files live in `src/routes/` and export `Route` using `createFileRoute()`
- Page components live in `src/pages/`, imported by route files
- Root layout is defined in `src/routes/__root.tsx`

## Navigation

- Use typed `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router` for navigation
- Avoid raw `<a>` tags for internal navigation

## Route Parameters

- Define route params with Zod validation when applicable
- Use `useParams()` and `useSearch()` hooks for accessing route data
