# React Component Conventions

## Exports

- Export components as named exports (not default)

## Naming

- Event handlers: prefix with `handle` (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`)
- Props interfaces: name as `ComponentNameProps`

## Accessibility

- Include accessibility attributes: ARIA labels, keyboard handlers, semantic HTML
- Interactive elements must have `onClick` and `onKeyDown` handlers

## Styling

- Use `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional Tailwind classes
- Avoid inline styles; use Tailwind classes exclusively
